all (?) solutions are written in base JavaScript, and are run via a simple HTML site.

why did i do it like this? uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

anyway to run these (if you want to do that for some reason) download "index.html" rom the root folder and put it in some directory with the js file you wanna run (there's one for each day).

thats it please be nice im new to this </3
