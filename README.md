all (?) solutions are written in base JavaScript, and are run via a simple HTML site.
why did i do it like this? uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

anyway to run these (if you want to do that for some reason) download "index.html" rom the root folder and put it in some directory with the js file you wanna run (there's one for each day), then you should? be able to run it from there? i do it by copying the file path from vsc but i assume literally just clicking the index.html does the trick

the website consists of the following:

- an input box - this is where you put the puzzle input

- button: check input (part 1) - checks the input using code from part 1 of that day's puzzle

- button: check input (part 2) - same but for part 2

- button: clear - clears the input box

- button: copy - copies the output to your clipboard

- a line of text where the output is printed to

also! there are libraries i used for certain solutions that im obviously not gonna steal for this repo so i'll link them here:

- md5.js - used in 2015-04 - made by enm178: https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-md5

to use these, add them to a directory the same way you did for that day's js file

thats all! please go easy on my bad code im still pretty new to all this :,>
