all (?) solutions are written in base JavaScript, and are run via a simple HTML site.
why did i do it like this? uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

anyway to run these (if you want to do that for some reason) download "index.html" rom the root folder and put it in some directory with the js file you wanna run (there's one for each day).

the website consists of the following:
an input box - this is where you put the puzzle input
four buttons
> check input (part 1) - checks the input using code from part 1 of that day's puzzle
> check input (part 2) - same but for part 2
> clear - clears the input box
> copy - copies the output to your clipboard
a line of text where the output is printed to

thats all! please go easy on my bad code im still pretty new to all this :,>
